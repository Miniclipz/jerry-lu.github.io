            <h2> Hello! </h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jerry Lu. I'm from Nashville, and I
                am currently a junior at the University of Pennsylvania, 
                where I study computer science and cognitive science.

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                I grew up in Nashville, TN and currently live in Philadelphia
                where I study at the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn, I'm a member
                of Penn Labs, a student run organization that makes websites and apps
                for students. I'm also the President of Penn Tech Review, a student
                publication that writes about tech, research, and entreprenuership
                at Penn and around Philly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Last summer, I worked at the National University of Singapore as a
                research assistant in Prof. Jimmy Peng's lab. I researched applications
                of machine learning, specifically GANs, in power systems.
                Previously, I spent a summer at Penn researching infant language
                acquisition. If you have any questions about research as an 
                Undergraduate, feel free to contact me. 

                I enjoy research, but I am currently seeking an internship in 
                the software development industry for the summer of 2020.

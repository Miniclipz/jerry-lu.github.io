                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                I grew up in Nashville and currently live in Philadelphia. 
                At Penn, I'm a member of <a href="https://pennlabs.org/">Penn Labs</a>, a student run organization that
                makes open-source products for students. This summer, I am working on Software Engineering Research
                as part of the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/scs/isr/reuse/">REUSE program</a> at Carnegie Mellon.
                </p>
                <p>
                Last summer, I worked at the National University of Singapore and researched applications of machine learning in power systems. Previously, I was a research assistant at Penn and worked on research in infant language acquisition. 
                </p>
                <p>I am currently seeking a full-time position in software development.</p>

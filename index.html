            <p>
                My name is Jerry Lu. I am currently a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, where I study computer science and cognitive science.

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                I grew up in Nashville, TN and currently live in Philadelphia
                where I am a student at the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn, I'm a member of Penn Labs, a student run organization that makes websites and apps
                for students. I am currently working on Software Engineering Research as part of the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/scs/isr/reuse/">REUSE program</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. I am working with Prof. Christian KÃ¤stner on managing computational notebooks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Last summer, I worked at the National University of Singapore as a
                research assistant in Prof. Jimmy Peng's lab. I researched applications
                of machine learning, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks, in power systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                Previously, I spent a summer at Penn researching infant language
                acquisition. If you have any questions about research as an 
                Undergraduate, feel free to contact me. 
                </p>
                <p>I am currently seeking a full-time position in software development.</p>
